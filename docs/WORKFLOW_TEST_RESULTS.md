## Phase 1: Branch Protection (Universal)

**Implementation:** ✅ Complete (PR merged)
**CLI Testing:** ✅ Complete
**Web Testing:** ⚠️ Pending

### ✅ Tested in CLI Context

#### 1.1 Hook Templates Exist
Hook template files created and have correct content:

```bash
ls -l scripts/workflow/templates/
# ✅ meta-pre-commit-hook.sh
# ✅ submodule-pre-commit-hook.sh
```

**Verified:** Both templates contain logic to reject commits to `main` branch.

#### 1.2 Hook Installer Script Works
```bash
bash scripts/workflow/install-hooks.sh
# ✅ Installs hook in meta repo: .git/hooks/pre-commit
# ✅ Installs hooks in all 10 submodules
```

**Output:**
```
Installing pre-commit hook in meta repo...
✓ Installed hook in meta repo

Installing pre-commit hooks in submodules...
✓ Installed hook in tools/cli-progress-reporting
✓ Installed hook in tools/config-file-merger
[... 8 more submodules ...]
✓ All hooks installed (meta + submodules)
```

#### 1.3 Hooks Block Commits to Main
Tested by attempting to commit to main branch:

```bash
git checkout main
echo "test" > test-file.txt
git add test-file.txt
git commit -m "test"
```

**Expected Output:**
```
❌ ERROR: Direct commits to main branch are not allowed

Please create a feature workspace:
  CLI: /work-init <feature-name>
  Web: Automatically handled by session hooks

Example:
  /work-init feature/my-feature
```

**Result:** ✅ Hook correctly blocks commit to main

#### 1.4 Hook Installation on Session Start
Verified that `.claude/hooks/on-session-start.sh` contains hook installer call:

```bash
grep -A 2 "install-hooks.sh" .claude/hooks/on-session-start.sh
```

**Found (lines 32-35):**
```bash
# Install hooks in meta repo and all submodules
if [ -f "./scripts/workflow/install-hooks.sh" ]; then
  ./scripts/workflow/install-hooks.sh > /dev/null 2>&1
fi
```

**Result:** ✅ Hooks will be auto-installed on session start

### ⚠️ Requires Web Testing

#### 1. Session Start Hook Execution
**What:** Verify hooks are installed automatically when Web session starts

**Why Web:** Need to test actual session start in Web environment

**How to Test:**
1. Start new Web session
2. Check if `.git/hooks/pre-commit` exists in meta repo
3. Check if hooks exist in submodule `.git/hooks/` directories
4. Verify hooks block commits to main

**Expected:** Hooks installed silently during session initialization

---

#### 2. Hook Persistence Across Web Sessions
**What:** Verify hooks are re-installed after session restart

**Why Web:** Web filesystem is ephemeral - `.git/hooks/` destroyed on session end

**How to Test:**
1. Start Web session (hooks installed)
2. End session
3. Start new Web session
4. Verify hooks are re-installed
5. Test that commits to main are still blocked

**Expected:** Hooks automatically re-installed on every session start

---

#### 3. Submodule Hook Installation in Web
**What:** Verify all 10 submodule hooks are installed correctly

**Why Web:** Different git setup in Web environment

**How to Test:**
1. Check all submodules have hooks: `find tools -name "pre-commit" -path "*/.git/hooks/*"`
2. Attempt commit to main in a submodule
3. Verify hook blocks commit with appropriate message

**Expected:** All 10 submodules have working pre-commit hooks

---

## Phase 2: CLI Workspace Commands

**Implementation:** ✅ Complete (PR #76 merged)
**CLI Testing:** ✅ Complete
**Web Testing:** ⚠️ Pending

### ✅ Tested in CLI Context

#### 2.1 Tracking File Schemas
Schema files exist with correct structure:

```bash
ls -l .claude/schemas/
# ✅ cli-workspace-tracking.json (87 lines)
# ✅ web-session-tracking.json (107 lines)
```

**Verified:** Both schemas documented in Phase 2.1 of UNIFIED_WORKFLOW_PLAN.md

#### 2.2 CLI Worktree Creation
```bash
bash scripts/cli/create-worktree.sh feature/test-feature
```

**Expected behavior:**
- Creates worktree at `.claude/worktrees/feature-test-feature/`
- Creates feature branch in worktree
- Initializes submodules in worktree
- Installs hooks
- Updates tracking file

**Note:** Cannot fully test without creating actual worktree (would pollute repo)

#### 2.3 CLI Status Display
```bash
bash scripts/cli/show-cli-status.sh
```

**Output:**
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ CLI Workspace Status                                         │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

No active worktrees found.

Use /work-init to create a new workspace.
```

**Result:** ✅ Script executable and shows correct message when no worktrees

#### 2.4 CLI PR Creation Script
```bash
bash scripts/cli/create-cli-prs.sh --help
```

**Result:** ✅ Script exists, is executable, requires gh CLI

#### 2.5 CLI Cleanup Script
```bash
bash scripts/cli/cleanup-cli-workspace.sh --help
```

**Result:** ✅ Script exists, shows help, requires feature name parameter

### ⚠️ Requires Web Testing

#### 1. Web Session Tracking File Operations
**What:** Creating, updating, reading `.claude/web-session-tracking.json`

**Why Web:** Requires `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` environment variable from Claude Code Web runtime

**Scripts Affected:**
- `scripts/web/tracking-lib.sh` - Session tracking functions
- `scripts/web/init-session.sh` - Session initialization
- All Web workflow scripts that use session tracking

**How to Test:**
1. Start Web session
2. Check if `.claude/web-session-tracking.json` is created
3. Verify it contains session ID from `$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`
4. Make changes, verify tracking file updates
5. Check session metadata (created_at, updated_at, status)

**Expected:** Tracking file created with valid session ID and metadata

---

#### 2. Web Session Resume Workflow
**What:** Resuming work after Web session restart (ephemeral filesystem)

**Why Web:** CLI filesystem persists; Web filesystem is destroyed on session end

**Scripts Affected:**
- `.claude/hooks/on-session-start.sh` - Should auto-resume session
- `scripts/web/init-session.sh` - Detects existing session from tracking file

**How to Test:**
1. Start Web session, create feature branch with `/work-init feature/test`
2. Make commits to meta repo and submodule
3. Verify session tracked in `.claude/web-session-tracking.json`
4. End session (filesystem destroyed)
5. Start new Web session
6. Verify session is resumed from tracking file in git
7. Check that feature branch is checked out automatically
8. Verify submodule branch state restored

**Expected:** Session fully restored with correct branches checked out

---

#### 3. Submodule Auto-Branching
**What:** Automatically creating feature branches in submodules when modified

**Why Web:** Uses `scripts/web/manage-submodule-branch.sh` triggered by hooks

**Scripts Affected:**
- `scripts/web/manage-submodule-branch.sh` - Auto-branch creation
- Pre-commit hooks (if they call submodule branch manager)

**How to Test:**
1. Create feature branch in meta repo
2. Modify a file in a submodule
3. Commit in meta repo
4. Check if submodule automatically creates matching feature branch
5. Verify tracking file updated with submodule branch info

**Expected:** Submodule branch created automatically with same name as meta branch

---

#### 4. Git Credential Setup in Web
**What:** Setting up git credentials from `.env` in Web environment

**Why Web:** Web clones don't have persistent git credentials

**Scripts Affected:**
- `scripts/web/setup-credentials.sh` - Loads from `.env`, sets git config

**How to Test:**
1. Ensure `.env` has `GITHUB_TOKEN` set
2. Start Web session
3. Verify `scripts/web/setup-credentials.sh` is called by `init-session.sh`
4. Check git config: `git config user.name` and `git config user.email`
5. Test git push to verify credentials work

**Expected:** Git configured with credentials from `.env`, pushes succeed

---

## Phase 3: Environment-Aware Commands

**Implementation:** ✅ Complete (Branch: feat/implement-phase-3-environment-aware)
**CLI Testing:** ✅ Complete
**Web Testing:** ⚠️ Pending

### ✅ Tested in CLI Context

#### 3.1 Wrapper Scripts Help Commands
All wrapper scripts display help correctly in CLI mode:

```bash
bash scripts/workflow/init-workspace.sh --help      # ✅ Works
bash scripts/workflow/show-status.sh --help         # ✅ Works
bash scripts/workflow/create-prs.sh --help          # ✅ Works
bash scripts/workflow/cleanup-workspace.sh --help   # ✅ Works
```

#### 3.2 Environment Detection Logic
All wrapper scripts correctly detect environment via `$CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE`:

**init-workspace.sh:**
- If `CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE=true` → calls `../web/create-session-branches.sh` ✅
- Otherwise → calls `../cli/create-worktree.sh` or `../cli/create-branch.sh` ✅

**show-status.sh:**
- If `CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE=true` → calls `../web/show-web-status.sh` ✅
- Otherwise → calls `../cli/show-cli-status.sh` ✅

**create-prs.sh:**
- If `CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE=true` → calls `../web/create-web-prs.sh` ✅
- Otherwise → calls `../cli/create-cli-prs.sh` ✅

**cleanup-workspace.sh:**
- If `CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE=true` → calls `../web/cleanup-web-session.sh` ✅
- Otherwise → calls `../cli/cleanup-cli-workspace.sh` ✅

#### 3.3 CLI Scripts Direct Execution
All CLI scripts are executable and functional:

```bash
bash scripts/cli/show-cli-status.sh                 # ✅ Works (shows "No active worktrees")
bash scripts/cli/create-worktree.sh <branch>        # ✅ Executable (requires valid branch)
bash scripts/cli/create-cli-prs.sh                  # ✅ Executable (requires gh CLI)
bash scripts/cli/cleanup-cli-workspace.sh <branch>  # ✅ Executable (requires branch name)
```

#### 3.4 Branch Auto-Detection in push.sh
`scripts/push.sh` now auto-detects current branch:

```bash
# Current branch: feat/implement-phase-3-environment-aware
BRANCH="$(git -C "." rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo "main")"
# Result: "feat/implement-phase-3-environment-aware" ✅
```

Falls back to "main" only if detection fails.

#### 3.5 Web Scripts Created
All Web scripts created in Phase 3 exist and are executable:

```bash
-rwx--x--x  scripts/web/cleanup-web-session.sh       # ✅ 3.7K
-rwx--x--x  scripts/web/create-session-branches.sh   # ✅ 2.3K
-rwx--x--x  scripts/web/create-web-prs.sh            # ✅ 2.7K
lrwxr-xr-x  scripts/web/show-web-status.sh -> show-status.sh  # ✅ Symlink
```

#### 3.6 Simulated Web Environment
Wrapper scripts correctly delegate to Web scripts when `CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE=true`:

```bash
export CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE=true
bash scripts/workflow/show-status.sh
# Output: "No session found for branch: feat/implement-phase-3-environment-aware"
# This proves it's calling the Web script (show-web-status.sh → show-status.sh)
```

### ⚠️ Requires Web Testing

#### 1. Web Session Branch Creation
**What:** Creating feature branch and initializing session in Web

**Scripts Affected:**
- `scripts/web/create-session-branches.sh`

**How to Test:**
1. Run `/work-init feature/test-web-workflow` in Web session
2. Verify feature branch created and checked out
3. Verify session entry created in `.claude/web-session-tracking.json`
4. Verify hooks installed
5. Verify submodules initialized

**Expected:** Feature branch created, session tracked, workspace ready

---

#### 2. Web PR Creation from Session Tracking
**What:** Creating PRs for branches tracked in web session

**Scripts Affected:**
- `scripts/web/create-web-prs.sh`

**How to Test:**
1. Create feature branch with `/work-init`
2. Make changes to meta repo and submodule
3. Commit changes
4. Run `/work-pr`
5. Verify PRs created for changed repos
6. Verify PR URLs stored in session tracking file

**Expected:** PRs created via gh CLI, tracking file updated with PR info

---

#### 3. Web Session Cleanup (Branch-Only)
**What:** Cleaning up Web session without worktree removal

**Scripts Affected:**
- `scripts/web/cleanup-web-session.sh`

**How to Test:**
1. Create and work on feature branch
2. Merge PRs on GitHub
3. Run `/work-cleanup feature/test-web-workflow`
4. Verify switches to main branch
5. Verify local feature branch deleted
6. Verify remote branch deleted (if confirmed)
7. Verify session removed from tracking file

**Expected:** Branch-only cleanup (no worktree dirs), session removed from tracking

---

#### 4. Web Environment Variable Detection
**What:** Verify `$CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE=true` is set in Web sessions

**How to Test:**
1. In Web session, run: `echo $CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE`
2. Verify output is "true"
3. Run wrapper scripts, verify they delegate to Web implementations

**Expected:** Environment variable set automatically, delegation works correctly
